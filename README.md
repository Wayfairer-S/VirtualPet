My virtual Pet. 

This little toy is a love letter to the best friend I have, my tri-colour Collie, Riley. He's getting on in his years, losing his vigour and year by year sprouting more grey whiskers, but to me he's as youthful and handsome as the day I first had him. I hope that this collection of 1's and 0's remains long after the old boy is gone, and he's remembered not as he left, but as he was. He means the world to me, and through this code he'll be here forever.
